A problem posed by Paul Graham is that of creating a function that takes a single (numeric) argument and 
which returns another function that is an accumulator. 
The returned accumulator function in turn also takes a single numeric argument, 
and returns the sum of all the numeric values passed in so far to that accumulator 
(including the initial value passed when the accumulator was created).

Create a function that takes a number n and generates accumulator functions that 
return the sum of every number ever passed to them.

Rules: Do not use global variables.

Hint: Closures save outer state.

function accumulator(sum) {
    let total = sum;
    return (num) => {
      total += num;
      return total;
    }
