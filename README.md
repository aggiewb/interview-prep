## Introduction to the Coding Interview Prep Algorithms
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/algorithms/

These challenges are meant to teach and challenge you with common algorithms that you will encounter in real life. These challenges will be a great learning experience to help improve your programming and logical skills.

In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ ) is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform calculations, data processing and automated reasoning tasks. In most of the coding interviews, foundation mostly means a clear understanding of basic data structures and algorithms.

This course presents you with the most frequently asked questions during interviews to prepare you with a basic understanding of algorithms. It will provide clear and concise explanations and implementations of different algorithms.

## Introduction to the Rosetta Code Problems

The Rosetta Code is a list of programming challenges which will help you build your programming skills.

"The idea is to present solutions to the same task in as many different languages as possible, to demonstrate how languages are similar and different, and to aid a person with a grounding in one approach to a problem in learning another." - Homepage of the Rosetta Code site
